# coronaDat

This repo contains official Covid19-related data provided by the Austrian ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection at [`info.gesundheitsministerium.at`](https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at). This repo we provide automatically (web)-scraped data so that data-analysis and visualisation is possible over time when aggregating the data inputs. As the data format from the portal has changed several times, this issues are also reflected here.

## Updates
### 17.4.2020
- Due to multiple changes in the data official data and as most of the data are provided as machine-readable data at [data.gv.at/covid-19](https://www.data.gv.at/covid-19) anyways, we are no longer (at least for now) pushing any computed (aggregated) time-series files.
